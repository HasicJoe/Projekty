Module "button"    (component GPIO_LDD)
   - button_Init -This method initializes the associated peripheral(s) and the component internal variables. The method is 
                called automatically as a part of the application initialization code.
   - button_SetFieldValue -This method sets the output data value of the specified bit field.
   - button_GetFieldValue -This method returns the current input data of the specified field.
   - button_ClearFieldBits -This method drives the specified bits of the specified bit field to the inactive level.
   - button_SetFieldBits -This method drives the specified bits of the specified bit field to the active level.
   - button_ToggleFieldBits -This method inverts the specified bits of the specified bit field to other level.

Module "d9"        (component LED)
   - d9_On -This turns the LED on.
   - d9_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - d9_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - d9_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - d9_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - d9_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - d9_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "d10"       (component LED)
   - d10_On -This turns the LED on.
   - d10_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - d10_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - d10_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - d10_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - d10_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - d10_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - d10_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "d11"       (component LED)
   - d11_On -This turns the LED on.
   - d11_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - d11_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - d11_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - d11_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - d11_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - d11_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - d11_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.

Module "d12"       (component LED)
   - d12_On -This turns the LED on.
   - d12_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - d12_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - d12_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - d12_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - d12_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.
   - d12_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - d12_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
